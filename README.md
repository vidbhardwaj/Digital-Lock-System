# Digital Locking System

## Summary
The Digital Locking System is an Embedded Systems Project illustrating how Secure Access Control solutions evolve as Versions. The Project demonstrates the continuous improvement of the Digital Locking System through Logic Validation at each stage of Development (Simulation, Hardware Deployment, Enhanced Security, and IoT scale).

The approach fits with the way that the Engineering Process creates and Deploys Systems over time.

## Project Execution Strategy
Digital Locking System has developed a Controlled Rollout plan.
- **v1** — Lock Logic Validation (Simulation)
- **v2** — Lock Logic Deployment (Hardware)
- **v3+** — Unified Security / Alerts / Scale Evolution.

To be successful, it is essential to have:
Consistency
Clarity
Discipline when developing Systems.

---

## Version Roadmap
- v1 — Logic Validation (Simulation)
- v2 — Hardware Development
- v3 — Attempt Counter / Access Restrictions
- v4 — Visual Indicators and Buzzers
- v5 — IoT logging and Scaling considerations.

---

## Technology Stack
- Arduino UNO
- Embedded C with the Arduino IDE
- Digital I/O peripherals
- Prototype on Breadboards.

---

## Purpose
The Digital Locking System will demonstrate a structured (Versioned) Project, which exemplifies Systematic thinking, Execution Discipline, and Scalable Embedded Design.
